# 📻 ls-radio-update 📻

Hello again, first of all the one who made the script initially was alcapone_dev,
I just made a brief modification of the alcapone_dev script.

# Installation
1. Install Script
2. Copy the project to your esx resource folder.
3. Add "start ls-radio-update" to your file `server.cfg`


# 🍀 Good Luck  🍀
